Helper stack view which updates the content inside to a VStack, or HStack,

// Constructs a Stack that can update the content to a HStack or VStack, based
// on the supplied Binding. This allows for content that doesn't scale well
// horizontally with larger text sizes to instead stack vertically. This
// also works with smaller text sizes, where there's enough space onscreen
// to lay out the content horizontally.

    // The content to update when the stack should be changed.

    // value indicates if the content should be in a VStack or HStack.
