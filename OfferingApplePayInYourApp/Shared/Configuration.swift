     The value of the `OFFERING_APPLE_PAY_BUNDLE_PREFIX` user-defined build
     setting is written to the Info.plist file of every target in Swift
     version of the sample project. Specifically, the value of
     `OFFERING_APPLE_PAY_BUNDLE_PREFIX` is used as the string value for a
     key of `AAPLOfferingApplePayBundlePrefix`. This value is loaded from the
     target's bundle by the lazily evaluated static variable "prefix" from
     the nested "Bundle" struct below the first time that "Bundle.prefix"
     is accessed. This avoids the need for developers to edit both
     `OFFERING_APPLE_PAY_BUNDLE_PREFIX` and the code below. The value of
     `Bundle.prefix` is then used as part of an interpolated string to insert
     the user-defined value of `OFFERING_APPLE_PAY_BUNDLE_PREFIX` into several
     static string constants below.
