# Displaying an Indoor Map

Use the Indoor Mapping Data Format (IMDF) to show an indoor map with custom overlays and points of interest.

## Overview

The sample app demonstrates decoding, rendering, and styling of a small subset of the IMDF feature types and their properties. Use these examples to create your own indoor map with a style that's consistent with your appâ€™s design. You'll need to handle feature categories that are specific to your venue, and configure the map style using your own colors, icons, and level picker.
