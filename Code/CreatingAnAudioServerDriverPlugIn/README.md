# Creating an Audio Server Driver Plug-in
Build a virtual audio device by creating a custom driver plug-in.

## Overview
This sample shows how to create a minimal Audio Server plug-in. Written in standard C, the sample provides the minimal implementation you need to publish a single, functioning audio device to the system. The audio device provides the following features:
- Configurable device primary volume, muting, and data sources
- 44.1 kHz and 48 kHz sample rates
- Two channels of audio I/O in 32-bit, floating point, linear PCM format

Install the sampleâ€™s `.driver` bundle to `/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/HAL` and reboot your computer. Use Audio MIDI Setup to inspect the newly installed device.
